## Project Overview
We're addressing potential credit card payment delays at FinanKu that could impact our business. Our goal is to build a predictive model accurately identifying at least 60% of customers likely to experience these delays.

## Key Variables
- **Customer ID, Branch, City:** Identifiers and location details
- **Age, Avg. Annual Income/Month:** Customer demographics and income
- **Balance (Q1-Q4):** Quarter-end balances
- **Num of Products (Q1-Q4):** Products owned at quarter-end
- **HasCrCard (Q1-Q4), Active Member (Q1-Q4):** Card ownership and customer activity
- **Unpaid Tagging:** Payment delay status

## Experiments
- **Review Periods:** Last year or last 6 months
- **Variable Adjustments:** Average balances, product counts, and activity status variations

## Objectives
Develop a predictive model with a 60%+ accuracy and recall to foresee potential credit card payment delays.
